# Retrieval Learning Bot

This Python script implements a Retrieval Learning Bot using NLTK and scikit-learn libraries. 
The bot engages in conversations by responding to user inputs, detecting greetings, and attempting to understand and respond to user queries using cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors of user input and pre-existing sentences.

## Usage

1. Start the conversation by typing a greeting (e.g., hello, hi).
2. Type your text after greeting to engage in conversation with the bot.
3. To end the conversation, type 'bye'.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.x recommended)
- NLTK
- scikit-learn

Ensure the `data.txt` file is available in the same directory as the script.
